title: Pure Nexus - SFMod
---
These days I was working on compiling and modifying Android system.

At first I want to use [CyanogenMod](https://cyanogenmod.org) as base of my Mod.

Ah... As you know, Cyngn [shut down CM Project and all of its services](https://cyngn.com/blog/cyanogen-services-shutting-down). Those developers went to a new project called [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org).

Then I heard about [SlimROMs](https://slimroms.org) form [PeterCxy](https://typeblog.net). After I compile their source code, I found that SlimROM may not support Google's Project Fi (Baseband works fine but it cannot identify my Project Fi SIM card). 

Finally I try to build [Pure Nexus](https://github.com/PureNexusProject) (Because my phone is Nexus 5X and other Nexus users had recommend me about the Pure Nexus Project). I also tried their official build and I found it supports Project Fi. But at the first time I was trying to get the source code of it, I don't know what's wrong with [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), I cannot acces Pure Nexus Project's repo on it. I sent issues to both GitLab and Pure Nexus Project on GitHub. Though nobody answered me but one day later I can successfully access the repo.

After I got their source code, I started modify it. I added support for [liudongmiao](https://github.com/liudongmiao)'s [Brevent](https://piebridge.me/pr/) and Change the default kernel (PureKernel) to [flar2(Aaron Segaert)](https://github.com/flar2)'s [ElementalX](https://elementalx.org) (Because I bought [EXKM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flar2.exkernelmanager) and I don't want to waste my mondy :D )

Finally it works. But I found there is still a small problem: Some application will crash due to `AndroidRuntime: java.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: XXXXXXXXXX; this requires android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL`

Source code manifest: https://github.com/RedL0tus/manifest

Here is the download link of my build: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5BS_3kBfTlkV1paTEk5OVpCc1E/view?usp=sharing)
