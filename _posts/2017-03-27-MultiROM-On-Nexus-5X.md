As a no-zuo-no-die-solaris, I want to install multi systems (a.k.a ROMs) on my Nexus 5X (bullhead). 

But I just searched for a long time, I found there are two ways to multi boot on Android devices: MultiROM & EFIDroid.

But both of MultiROM and EFIDroid don't have official support to Nexus 5X.

After several times of searching, I found that there is a people who already done porting of MultiROM to Nexus 5X.

You can get source code here: [@jollaman999/multirom at GitHub](https://github.com/jollaman999/multirom)  
And modified version of TWRP's source code: [@jollaman/Team-Win-Recovery-Project at GitHub](https://github.com/jollaman999/Team-Win-Recovery-Project)  

I've tested on my device and it can work correctly.

In order to use it, the easiest way is download the modified version of MultiROM Manager. You can find it at [here](https://github.com/jollaman999/MultiROMMgr/tree/master/MultiROMMgr).

Once you open the MultiROM Manager and give it root access, you can use it as the normal MultiROM manager.

Have fun!
