- I am a high school student, yet.

- I'm not a good code writer.
  - [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) products hate me.
  - [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) is a Calculator.
  - [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a Game.
  - [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) is my favourite ~~IDE~~ editor (switching to vim).

- My devices:
  - ThinkPad P50 (20ENCTO1WW) running [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org) GNU/Linux & Windows 10.
  - ThinkPad X220 (42918G1) running [AOSC OS](https://aosc.io).
  - ThinkPad 360C running Windows 95 (Flying toasters!).
  - Apple iBook G4 14" @ 1.42GHz running AOSC OS (It's ~~impossible~~ reaaaaaaly hard to replace it's hard drive w/o breaking anything).
  - (Planning to replace P50 with an ITX Ryzen machine)~~(インポッシブル)~~
