Welcome to Way to be vegetable~ ( \ Chinglish /

[中文](https://v2bv.net/about-zh/)

- I am a high school student, yet.

- I'm not a good code writer.
  - [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) products works well with me... for now.
  - Trying to study Rust, but seems it's too hard for me as I'm not experienced and I don't have any instructors that can help me. Planning to buy some books for it.
- My devices:
  - ThinkPad P50 (20ENCTO1WW) running [AOSC OS](https://aosc.io) GNU/Linux & Windows 10 (Which is currently unusable because Shintel's garbage-like wireless card driver).
  - ThinkPad X220 (42918G1) running [NixOS](https://nixos.org).
  - ThinkPad 360C running Windows 95 (Flying toasters!).
  - Apple iBook G4 14" @ 1.42GHz "eating dust" without OS installed since I replaced the hard drive a long time ago.
  - Lilac running stock Android.
  - Bullhead currently running some Halium based OS.
  - Hammerhead running Android.
  - Saana running Windows 10 Mobile (Of course, what else can it run?).
  - NX

- My sites:
  - [Mastodon](https://s.brined.fish)
  - [Download site](https://dl.v2bv.net)
  - [Experimental blog](https://brined.fish/SaltedBlog/)
  - ... and some others.

- Interests:
  - Anime (Yes I'm an Otaku).
  - Game. <!-- My Steam profile: https://steamcommunity.com/id/red_l0tus/ -->
  - Music (Mostly J-Pop, especially Aimer).

- Someting else:
  - Kinda open source enthusiast. Supporter of FSF (though I'm not completely agree with all of their ideas), EFF, LF.
  - Kinda AOSC (Always Overuse Shell Community) [member](https://aosc.io/people/~redl0tus).
    - ~~Never done any packaging stuff.~~ XD
    - Just wrote a ugly [pakreqBot](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/pakreqBot) for ~~executing JellyBai~~ and drew several stickers for AOSCC.
    - I rewrote that bot, right now it's pakreqBot-ng written in Python, built with aiohttp, aiosqlite, aiogram, and so on. ~~trinity of async I/O telegram bot.~~
  - Kinda cat lover (But in fact, I never touched any cat, they just ran away when I'm trying to be close to them)(Which is pretty sad).
  - Tons of unfinished projects.
  - RAmen.

- Digital identity:
  - E-Mail: <code>YVVCMk1tSjJMbTVsZEE9PQ==</code> <!-- Just simply done base64 for two times.-->
