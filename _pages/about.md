Welcome to Way to be vegetable~ ( \ Chinglish /

And:  
- I'm not good at writing code.(My level of wring Haskell is still at [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) As A Calculator).
- I'm using a ThinkPad P50.
- I'm a Linux user (But I still have a Windows installed, because I need Windows to play games XD)<!-- My Steam profile: https://steamcommunity.com/id/red_l0tus/ -->
- I don't like Apple, Inc, though I have a iBook G4 (\\\ PowerPC ///).
- Always "watering" at AOSC~~(Always Overuse bracketS Community)~~. Check this: [https://aosc.io/people/~redl0tus](https://aosc.io/people/~redl0tus)
